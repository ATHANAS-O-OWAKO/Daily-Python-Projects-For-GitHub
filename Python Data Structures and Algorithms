1. Why would you use the 11pass11 statement? 

Problem: In Python, there are situations where you need a way to create a 
placeholder or acknowledge an operation without specifying its details. This is 
especially common during code development and design when certain parts 
of your code are not yet fully implemented. 

Solution: The "pass" statement in Python serves as a simple solution to 
address these situations. It is used in the following scenarios: 

Code Skeleton: Use "pass" as a placeholder when defining functions, classes, 
or code blocks that are not yet implemented. 
def my_function(): 
    pass # Placeholder for future implementation 

Conditional Statements: In conditional branches, use "pass" to acknowledge 
a condition without needing to execute specific code. 
if condition: 
    # Code to run when the condition is True 
else: 
    pass # Acknowledges the False case without action 

Empty Classes: For class definitions without attributes or methods, use "pass" 
as a placeholder. 
class MyClass: 
    pass # Awaiting the addition of attributes and methods 

Exception Handling: When handling exceptions, use "pass" to acknowledge 
an exception without taking specific actions. 
try: 
   # Code that might raise an exception 
except SomeException: 
   pass # Acknowledges the exception without any action

Loop Structures: In loops, use "pass" as a placeholder when you need to 
iterate over elements without performing specific actions. 
for item in my_list: 
    pass # A placeholder for future processing
